Repo For Project 1

## Option Metrics as Predictors of Equity Prices

## Group Members
* Nestor Aviles
* Val Shulyak
* Will Hua
* Sam Remy

## Project Description: attempt to predict future prices/performance of securities based upon specific metrics of 90-day, at-the-money options. E.g. premium, volume, put/call ratios, and open interest. 

## Questions to Answer: 
* Can 90-day at-the-money options prices accurately and reliably predict the movement (magnitude and direction) of stock prices? 
* Benchmarking: Does the performance of the proposed model beat the SP500? 
* Which variable has the strongest predictive power?

## Potential Datasets: Alpaca API, Google Finance API, Quandl, CBOE/All Access API

## Libraries: PyPI, Pandas, Hvplot, PyViz

## Presentation ideas: 
* bullish and bearish panels - scatter w/ quadrants
* R-squared/correalation of model
* Boxplot of obseved performance for a set of stocks in scope
* Comparison of Prediction Model vs. SP500 (line)

## Tasks
1) Collect datasets
2) Pull datasets into Pandas
3) Clean datas
4) Build graphs
5) Analyze Results
6) Conculsion
