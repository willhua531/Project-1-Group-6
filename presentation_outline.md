## What we did?
Using 2020 SPY (S&P500 ETF) data, we tested whether various daily reported options variables - price, volume, open interest, and time value - appeared to be strong predictors of future stock prices. 

## Questions to Answer: 
* What are correlations among the variables?
* How do the daily prices, volumes, open interest and etc. of call and put options relate to daily stock prices?
* How do stock prices compare with options implied closing prices?

## How did we Answer?
* We combined daily stock price and option data from SPY
* We created a correlation matrix across variables
* We plotted the relationship between stock prices and multiple variables over time to determine where prediction may be possible.

## Findings:
* We found that there does appear to exist a semi-strong positive correlation between stock prices and various option market metrics (i.e. options can be used to predict future stock prices, to an extent), though the actual mathematical relationship would need to be explored further. We also observed how these relationships can become strained and even break in the face of exogenous shocks, such as was seen in March 2020.
